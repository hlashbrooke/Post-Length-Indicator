== Description ==

"Post Length Indicator" displays a dual-coloured bar along side the browser's scrollbar that shows readers what portion of the page contains the actual post content and what portion contains the comments. This is perfect for blogs that receive a lot of comments as it indicates to readers how long the article is and saves you from having readers turn away because your post appears too long.

The colours of the indicator can be changed from the plugin settings page, as well as the post types for which it must appear.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I need a plugin like this? =

When a visitor comes to an article with a really long scrollbar, they are often put off because it appears that the article is longer than it actually is. This plugin solves that problem by showing your readers how long your article is from the get go. It also allows people to scroll directly to the comments section of the post because they will know exactly how far down the page it is.
